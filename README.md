# Bike Sharing Data Science Project

## Description
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Bike Sharing dataset using Python. The project focuses on data cleaning, statistical analysis, grouping, and visualizations to uncover patterns in bike usage.

## Features
The project performs the following:

- Imports required Python libraries  
- Reads and loads the Bike Sharing dataset  
- Renames columns to standardized labels:  
  **Time Stamp, Count, Temperature, F_Temp, Humidity, Wind Speed, Weather Code, is Holiday, is Weekend, Season**  
- Computes total number of rows  
- Displays the first 24 and last 24 rows  
- Calculates:  
  - Highest bike share count  
  - Average bike shares per season  
  - Number of bike shares in hottest and coldest weather  
  - Number of bike shares when wind speed is highest  
  - Lowest bike shares in winter  
  - Highest bike shares in autumn  
  - Average humidity in spring  
- Performs grouping by **Season**  
- Creates visualizations:  
  - Scatter chart of bike shares by temperature  
  - Pie chart of bike shares distribution by season
